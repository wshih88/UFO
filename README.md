# UFO Sightings
## We created a website to allow public access to a database containing reported UFO sightings. Using a combination of JavaScript and HTML, we established a more user-friendly approach to viewing the data through filters. By creating filters, the mass amounts of reports become much more manageable for readers.

## Future improvements could include adding a photo section if photo evidence of reported sightings are available.
